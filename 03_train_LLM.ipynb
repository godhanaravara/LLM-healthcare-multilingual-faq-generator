    "## 03: Fine-Tune LLM for Medical FAQ Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "This notebook fine-tunes a `google/flan-t5-base` model on the preprocessed Medical FAQ dataset (`preprocessed_medquad.parquet`, 16,359 rows) to generate accurate answers for healthcare questions. It uses Hugging Face Transformers for training, tokenization, and evaluation, preparing the model for downstream RAG and multilingual FAQ applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "- Convert Spark DataFrame to Hugging Face Dataset for fine-tuning.\n",
    "- Tokenize QA pairs and train the model with Seq2SeqTrainer.\n",
    "- Save the fine-tuned model and demonstrate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Value\n",
    "- Creates a domain-specific LLM for telehealth FAQs, enabling accurate, context-aware responses to reduce clinician workload.\n",
    "- Supports multilingual expansion (e.g., Spanish translations), improving patient accessibility.\n",
    "- Accelerates FAQ generation, potentially saving healthcare providers 60% in response time (per Azure economics).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Approach\n",
    "- **Input**: `preprocessed_medquad.parquet` with lemmatized questions and original answers.\n",
    "- **Model**: `google/flan-t5-base` (Seq2Seq, 250M parameters) fine-tuned for 3 epochs.\n",
    "- **Training**: 90/10 train/validation split, max_length=128 input/256 output, batch_size=3.\n",
    "- **Output**: Fine-tuned model at `/dbfs/mnt/faqdata/finetuned_llm_prototype` and demo predictions.\n",
    "- **Runtime**: ~30-60 minutes on Databricks Community Edition (CPU/GPU if available).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Preprocessed data from 02_preprocess_medquad.ipynb.\n",
    "- Hugging Face Transformers and Datasets installed.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook fine-tuned `google/flan-t5-base` on 16,359 preprocessed Medical FAQ pairs, achieving an eval_loss of ~1.589 after 3 epochs, and evaluated 500 validation samples with ROUGE scores (ROUGE-1: 0.316, ROUGE-L: 0.248). The model was saved as `finetuned_llm_prototype`, and predictions were generated for dataset samples and a new question (\"symptoms of continuous headache\"). While some answers were accurate (e.g., spastic paraplegia inheritance), hallucinations were observed (e.g., headache symptoms for PAD, incorrect CKD nutrition), indicating the need for RAG grounding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Results\n",
    "- **Dataset**: 16,359 QA pairs tokenized, split 90/10 (14,723 train, 1,636 validation).\n",
    "- **Training**: 3 epochs, batch_size=3, eval_loss from 1.681 to 1.589.\n",
    "- **Evaluation**: 500 samples, ROUGE-1: 0.316, ROUGE-2: 0.172, ROUGE-L: 0.248, ROUGE-Lsum: 0.253.\n",
    "- **Outputs**: Fine-tuned model, `eval_preds.csv`, `rouge.json`.\n",
    "- **Demo**: Predictions showed strengths (correct inheritance) and weaknesses (hallucinations).\n",
    "- **Runtime**: ~37 hours training, ~1 hour 33 minutes evaluation on Databricks Community Edition (CPU).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Impact\n",
    "- Produces a domain-specific LLM for telehealth FAQs, reducing clinician time on common queries.\n",
    "- Evaluation data supports iterative improvements, enhancing FAQ reliability for patient care.\n",
    "- Sets foundation for multilingual support and RAG, promoting equitable healthcare access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "- **RAG Pipeline**: Build retrieval with LangChain and FAISS to ground predictions in dataset context (04_langchain_RAG.ipynb).\n",
    "- **Verdict Assignment**: Add TF-IDF similarity and keyword rules to `eval_preds.csv` for `Correct`/`Incorrect` verdicts.\n",
    "- **Multilingual Expansion**: Translate 331 `Correct` answers to Spanish/Telugu using GCP Translation API.\n",
    "- **Deployment**: Develop Streamlit app for interactive FAQ queries, deployable on AWS SageMaker.\n",
    "- **Portfolio Polish**: Update GitHub README with model performance, ROUGE scores, and screenshot of `eval_preds.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step showcases LLM fine-tuning with Hugging Face, cloud integration, and evaluation for healthcare applications."
